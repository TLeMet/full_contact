These python scripts are useful for automating the counting of protein-membrane contacts using GROMACS mindist and plotting results.

It can also add the mean distance between membrane and protein if prot_z.xvg and membrane_z.xvg files output by gmx traj and containing the Z_coordinate of COMs for both groups over the run are provided.

Contacts counting can be refined to specific lipid types or amino-acids using special_contact.
